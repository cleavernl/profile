=== Default Key Bindings ===

]c = jump to next change
[c = jump to previous change
do = get changes from other window into the current window
dp = put the changes from the curent window into the other window
zo = open fold
zc = close fold
zr = reduce the fold level by 1
zm = incease the fold level by 1 (1 more fold level)

:diffu = recalculate the diff

=== Recommended Additional Mappings ===

nd -> ]c = "next diff"
pd -> [c = "previous diff"
ad -> do = "accept diff"

rd -> :diffu = "re-diff"

To put these mappings in your vimdiff, add the following to your ~/.vimrc file
if &diff
  nnoremap nd ]c
  nnoremap pd [c
  nnoremap ad do
  nnoremap rd :diffu
endif
